#<center> <h1>Flute Characterization</h1> </center>


The goal of this project is to characterize some acoustic or electrical instruments using wave theory, we going to study simple cases like drums or flutes.


For this purpose, the project will divide into three parts:


* **Theoretical**: How to model the phenomena with physics theory?. Trying to solve some questions like what is the most approximate physical model? which parameters are involve?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Lina Duque


* **Experimental**: The main problem is how to measure acoustic properties and what else can be measured.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Andrea Mora


* **Computational**: For this part, we are going to base in a Lattice Boltzmann for acoustic waves, where the pressure is the main character. The idea is to set up the boundary conditions and how to compare them with experimental data.
The Lattice Boltzmann code is already done in c++.
