<center> <h1>Record characterization and simulation</h1> </center>


The objective of this project is to characterize recoder (musical instrument) using wave theory, simulation programms and audio data analysis apps and recording apps. Expected to be expanded to other types of instruments.


For this purpose, the project is divide in three parts:


* **Theoretical**: How to model the phenomena with physics theory. Trying to represent the flute by wave and fluid theories including its border conditiones and other parameters. Relate by equation ways to define record's characterists. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Diego Mendoza


* **Experimental**: Search for the most movenient, simple, and free access apps, to record sound from the recorder and get its data to be analyzed. From this analysis find by theory equations its characteristics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Lina Duque


* **Computational**: To be based in a Lattice Boltzmann for acoustic waves, where the pressure is the main character. The idea is to set up the boundary conditions and how to compare them with experimental data.
The Lattice Boltzmann code is already done in c++.
