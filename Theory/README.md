The idea of this folder is to show you how we analyse the acoustic physics of a flute. First of all, we are going to start with a sound wave equation. Of course, the fact that air currents lead to a wave ecuation like we show in (1)  has to be demostrated. We will explain this with more detail in the extensive work. 
So as not to complicate things, we start in (1)

The solution for this equation (1) it is usually as follows:
