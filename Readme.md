<center> <h1>Recorder characterization and simulation</h1> </center>


The recorder is one of the most common instruments in the world, that has through the years evolved, and crease a decrease in relevance. Nowadays it is accessible to many people to play it, as part of the basic music education in schools and institutes.

In this repository it is studied the recorder from waves and fluids theory, measurement of acoustic properties and simulate sound waves. The present project has the objective to study and characterize some properties of this instrument from three physics approaches:

* **Theory**: To model the recorder phenomena that make it sounds using waves and fluids theory. Defining boundary conditions and holes, study the impedance, sound pressure level (SPL), instensity, and other acoustic concepts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Felipe De La Ossa


* **Experiment**: To investigate how to measure acustic properties from an analogic wave playing the recorder. Looking for best quality data from measurements, determinate the most adequate tecniques and devices, to analyze through digital processing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Lina Duque


* **Simulation**: To simulate waves propagation in a recorder with and without holes using a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Design an algorithm with boundary conditions to obtain measurable data. And compare simulation time of different languages, such as python or C++.

Finally to get a better understanding of music in a simple air instrument studied from a physic perspective, it is compared data obtained from the theory, experiment and simulation parts. You can find particular details in each folder (previus documentation and some of work done) and all documents created in Documents.md file.
