A scientist is a person who never stops asking neither investigating, they have a huge curiosity for the surrounding world and how it works. Thanks to this quality we were able to develop a universal language that everyone can hear and feel....  music, what will be without it? This curiosity characterizes the human being leading him to invent the first instrument that dates back to 40000 years , a bone flute from the city of Geißenklösterle.

Now, the flute is one of the most common instruments in the world and it is accessible to many people to play it. It has  evolved to professional instruments that may differ from the initial "simple" bone instrument.

As physicists, we can study music from waves and oscillations theory, but we can also measure acoustic properties and simulate sound waves. The present project has the goal to study and characterize some properties of instrumental acoustics from the three branches of physics:

* **Theory**: Model flute phenomena using waves and fluids theory studying how to define boundary conditions and holes, moreover study the impedance, sound pressure level (SPL), and other acoustic concepts and how they can be defined in physics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Felipe De La Ossa


* **Experiments**: Investigate how  acoustic instruments  have been studied and how it can be measured. Make some measurements and compare technics (formats and microphones) looking for the best quality data to do some audio analysis through digital processing, SPL plots, Fourier space, and harmonics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader: Lina Duque


* **Simulation**: Simulate waves propagation in a flute with and without holes using a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Design an algorithm with boundary conditions to obtain measurable data. Compare simulation time of different languages, such as python or C++.

The objective is to get a better understanding of music studying it from a physics perspective, comparing data measured as well as  the data generated by theory and simulation. You can find particular details in each folder and all documents created in Documents.md file.
